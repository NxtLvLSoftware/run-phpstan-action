## How to use
Simple analysis if php and phpstan is already configured properly in the action environment (in `$PATH`):

```yml
name: My PHP Test Workflow
on: [push]
jobs:
  test-code:
    name: Run Tests
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: nxtlvlsoftware/run-phpstan-action@v1
        with:
          analyse: src
          config: tests/phpstan/action.phpstan.neon
          level: 9
```

Or provide the paths to existing PHPStan and/or php executables:
```yml
name: My PHP Test Workflow
on: [push]
jobs:
  test-code:
    name: Run Tests
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: nxtlvlsoftware/run-phpstan-action@v1
        with:
          analyse: src
          config: tests/phpstan/action.phpstan.neon
          level: 9
          php: '/path/to/php/bin'
          phpstan: '/path/to/phpstan.phar'
```
